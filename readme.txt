How to Play:
Now that you have made a name for yourself, many people from your
hometown want to fight you to take your global position. Fight against
these various challengers and prove your worth!

Before playing, be sure to check the character select screen and decide
if you will play solo or with a partner. If playing 2 player, please
uncheck the CPU box in the bottom left of the screen. You can select
player one's character by left clicking on the challenger icon, and you
can select player two's character by right clicking on the challenger
icon. Please note that if you are playing against a CPU, your enemies
will come in waves, so you cannot select a challenger to play against.
