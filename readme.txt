How to Play:
  Now that you have made a name for yourself, many people from your hometown want to fight you to take your global position. Fight against these various challengers and prove your worth!

  Before playing, check the character select screen and decide if you will play solo or with a partner.
  If playing two players, please uncheck the CPU box in the bottom left of the screen.
  You can select player one's character by left-clicking on the challenger icon, and player two's character by right-clicking on the challenger icon.
  Please note that if you are playing against a CPU, your enemies will come in waves, so you cannot select a challenger to play against.
